# desk-face-detection
I spend a lot of time at my desk - maybe too much. But how much exactly? The goal of this project was to find out! My initial idea was a screen tracking software. Plenty already exist, so I just downloaded one and began using it. Pretty soon I realized that I spend a lot of time off the screen, but still at my desk - reading, thinking, spinning around in my chair, so on. Two alternatives were a face-tracking algorithm, and an Arduino-based pressure/proximity sensor on my chair. I went with the face-tracker, mainly because I had no idea how it would work, and I wanted to find out! There's still work to be done, but here's my functioning prototype.
## Use
This program makes use of the OpenCV library, so you'll have to download that before you run the code. To stop the program, open the tab which shows the annotated webcam output and hold space bar. Your daily stats will be logged in the output.txt file.
